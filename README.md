# React Native NavDrawer Template
A simple react native template setup with react-navigation's DrawerNavigator and proper project structure with two simple screens.

## Generating new react native project using this template
`react-native init <ProjectName> --template navdrawer`

After you create your new react native project using above command, all the required dependencies including react-navigation will also be installed and linked and you will see a new  **app** folder with **App.js** file and **home** and **login** directory with two screens. You can delete the **App.js** in your project's root folder and continue making modifications to app by modifying everything inside app folder.
